#   GitHub Workflow
There are five basic steps that will walk you through how to introduce change.
1. **BRANCHING**

  *  We donotever want to make changes directly on to 'main' so the first thing we do is create another branch.

2. **COMMITS**

* Now commits are sort of like making canges.
  
*   Whenever you make a set of changes you make a sommit and it stores all of those changes by taking a snapshot of your repository your project at a time.

3. **Pull Requests**
*    in this Pull Request you're comparing the branch you made with another branch,like"main".

* it gives you an opportunity to look at the differences those teo branches,and show other people the difference as well.ONce you do that ,and they see the changes,then you can collaborate on them.
4. **Collaborate**
*   the might give you a 'thumbs-up',and say it looks great,or they might have some critiques and suggestions -and thats good,that's the point,right?
5. **Merge**
* once you've reached a consensus that it's in a good place ,you marge.
* When you marge ,you're taking the branch you created and the commits on that branch and putting them into "main" so all of those snapshots are in the production
